## Product vision statement

We aim to create a streamlined and intuitive web application for budget tracking, designed to facilitate financial management and promote responsible spending. 

## User stories

- As a financially independent student, I want to track my spending across different categories like food, rent, and entertainment so that I can determine areas where I can cut back to stay within my budget.
- As a student with limited income, I need to set a budget and add additional income.
- As a older tech user, I need simplicity in design with my budget app.
- As a IPhone enthusist, I want the budget tracker to work on the phone screen
